HtL Project Proposal â€“ Bear With Me

# Part I: Project Proposal

*[Review in class on Thursday 2/1]*

## What is the main idea of your project?

Creating authentic human connection in the modern world, via bear.

## What functionality will you demonstrate on Show & Tell? Divide this into MVP and Stretch Goals. 

MVP: 

When you call, the Bear calls someone else (who has registered) and connects you into a conference call. 

Stretch Goals: 

* Signup workflow with user contact time preferences

* User call frequency preferences, and initiating connections

* Fancy conversation starters

* Security

## What are the ranked risks to your project's success?

1. Calls aren't fun

2. Nobody signs up

3. Missed feature completeness for learning goals

4. Make more bad features instead of fewer good features (test & docs)

5. Unintuitive user experience (unusable)

6. Thermonuclear War breaks out

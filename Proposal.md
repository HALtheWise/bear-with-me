HtL Project Proposal – Bear With Me

Team members: Eric, Jared, Toby

# Part I: Project Proposal

*[Review in class on Thursday 2/1]*

## What is the main idea of your project?

Creating authentic human connection in the modern world, via bear.

## What functionality will you demonstrate on Show & Tell? Divide this into MVP and Stretch Goals. 

MVP: 

When you call, the Bear calls someone else (who has registered) and connects you into a conference call. 

Stretch Goals: 

* User call frequency preferences, and initiating connections

* Fancy conversation starters

* Signup workflow with user contact time preferences

* Security

## What are the ranked risks to your project's success?

1. Calls aren't fun

2. Nobody signs up

3. Missed feature completeness for learning goals

4. Make more bad features instead of fewer good features (test & docs)

5. Unintuitive user experience (unusable)

6. Thermonuclear War breaks out

**_What resources (pointers to information, time with instructors) will help you succeed?_**

# Part II: Plan of Study

*[Due by noon on Monday 2/4]*

For each practice area:

How you will demonstrate command of this area? What does success look like? [2-5 sentences]

## Continuous Integration (Eric)

A successful continuous integration pipeline will...

* Automatically integrate and test changes to the code before they have been merged into master

    * (extension) require tests to pass before merging to master

* Execute both unit and integration tests

* Execute tests both locally on the development machine and in the cloud

* Be reasonably well-documented and understandable by future users of the project.

The technology that I have seen used other places most commonly is Jenkins CI, but I am open to other approaches

## Storage (Jared)

Setup both a production and a local database, with a migrations workflow for development. 

Document setup instructions, and use flask_sqlalchemy as an ORM. 

Get comfy with postgres.

## Security (Toby)

Keep an eye out for injection points.

Make sure debugging endpoints are removed before deployment.

Protect against malicious callbacks.
